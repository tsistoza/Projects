University of Hawaii's Alma Mater

In green Manoa valley our Alma mater stands
Where mountain winds and showers refresh her fertile lands;
The flag of freedome beckons above her shining walls,
To larger truth and service our Alma Mater calls.

Hawaii, we have gathered within thy wide-flung doors.
As sons and daughters claiming her freely offered stores;
Our loyal praise we tender, and pledge to hold thy aim,
Till ocean's far horizons shall hear thy honored name.
